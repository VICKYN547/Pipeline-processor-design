üß≠ Overview of Pipelined Processor Design
A pipelined processor executes multiple instructions simultaneously by dividing instruction execution into distinct stages. Each stage performs a part of the instruction cycle, allowing overlapping execution‚Äîsimilar to an assembly line.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Concept:
Instead of executing one instruction at a time (as in a non-pipelined processor), a pipelined processor breaks the instruction execution into stages (e.g., Fetch, Decode, Execute, etc.) and works on multiple instructions at different stages in parallel.
